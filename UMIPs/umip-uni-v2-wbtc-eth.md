## SUMMARY

The DVM should support price requests for Uniswap V2 WBTC-ETH LP tokens.

## MOTIVATION

The DVM currently does not support Uniswap V2 WBTC-ETH LP tokens.

By enabling uni-V2-WBTC-ETH as a price identifier, UMA will open the door for the creation of synths with CFMM (constant function market maker) LP positions. The Uniswap V2 WBTC-ETH market is one of the largest CFMM pools with $345 million in liquidity supplied as of February 09, 2021. 

The LP Dollar team will use the uni-V2-WBTC-ETH price identifier to enable fixed borrowing costs for Uniswap V2 WBTC-ETH liquidity providers.
